# Secure Wireless Network Setup for Technova Solutions âœ…

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
Technova Solutions faced multiple unauthorized Wi-Fi access attempts, exposing vulnerabilities in their corporate network.  
As an **IT Administrator** during my Cybersecurity Internship, my role was to **design and implement a secure wireless network infrastructure** for the companyâ€™s headquarters, ensuring stability, confidentiality, and integrity of the network.

---

## ðŸ›¡ Problem Statement
The organizationâ€™s Wi-Fi network had:
- Unauthorized device connections.
- Weak encryption standards.
- Default router login credentials.
- No MAC address restrictions.

This created potential entry points for cyberattacks.

---
## ðŸ’¡ Key Responsibilities
- âœ… **Configured Static WAN IP** for stable internet connectivity.  
- âœ… **Set up secured SSID** with **WPA2 encryption**.  
- âœ… **Implemented MAC Address Filtering** to block unauthorized devices.  
- âœ… **Changed router default login credentials** and used **strong, unique admin credentials**.

## ðŸ›  Tools & Technologies Used
- **Cisco Packet Tracer** (Simulation Environment)
- Networking Concepts: Static IP, WPA2, MAC Filtering
- Security Best Practices for Network Administration

## ðŸ—‚ Project Steps
1. **Network Topology Design**  
   - Created a network layout with servers, switches, and routers.
2. **Router Configuration**  
   - Assigned static WAN IP and enabled DHCP for local clients.
3. **Wireless Security Setup**  
   - Configured SSID with WPA2 encryption.
4. **MAC Filtering**  
   - Allowed only whitelisted devices to connect.
5. **Credential Hardening**  
   - Changed default login details to strong credentials.
6. **Testing**  
   - Simulated connection attempts from authorized and unauthorized devices.
